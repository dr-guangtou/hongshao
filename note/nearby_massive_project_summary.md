## Project only about massive galaxies


### MASSIVE Survey:

    * D < 108 Mpc (z < 0.025; or cz < 7560 km/s using h=0.7)
    * M_K < -25.3 (logM > 11.5); From 2MASS/XSC
    * delta > 6 deg; A_v (Galactic) < 0.6
    * E or S0 morphology (from HyperLeda)
    * 116 candidate galaxies; 78 with SDSS photometry
