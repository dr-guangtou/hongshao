# Lessons

Mistakes, gotchas, and decisions worth remembering. Review at session start.

## Data handling (TNG300 drop)

- **Measure before encoding a data cut.** "Exclude halos whose mass decreases"
  sounded simple, but 98.6% of halos have *some* per-step decrease (median worst
  step ~4%) — normal fluctuation. The meaningful cut is net post-peak decline
  (z=0.4 mass >5% below historical peak → 695 halos). Always probe the
  distribution before choosing a threshold.
- **Verify snapshot indexing empirically, don't assume.** The MAH pickle is
  0-based TNG-native (snaps 1–71; snap 72 = z=0.4 is the unstored observation
  epoch). Confirmed by matching the cosmic-time file `t[snap]` to astropy ages
  at the anchors to <1 Myr. `t` indexes directly with no offset.
- **Don't trust file extensions.** `map_tng100_hist_stellar.hdf5` was 852 MB of
  all-zero bytes, not HDF5. Check magic bytes / load before relying on a file.
- **CoG / aperture arrays can be object-dtype with `None` bins** (~1/484). Coerce
  to NaN and mask; don't assume clean float arrays.

## Analysis / interpretation

- **Don't conflate "a parameter is unpredictable" with "the signal is weak."**
  In exp08 the radial-DiffMAH shape params predict poorly from the MAH (R²≤0.22),
  and I wrote that "the MAH's influence on shape is weak." Wrong: a direct
  decomposition shows the MAH explains ~24% of the at-fixed-M0 variance in
  *concentration* (`log M(<10)/M(<100)`, R²+0.17, r≈0.45 — matching exp02/06).
  The shape signal is real and moderate; the radial-DiffMAH params are a
  degenerate, nonlinear *coordinate system* (β_in↔R_c=−0.54) that buries it.
  Lesson: when a parametric target predicts poorly, test the predictability of
  the *observable* it encodes (aperture masses, ratios, PCA modes) before
  concluding the signal is absent. Fixing one param (Δ, DiffMAH-style) doesn't
  fix a multi-axis degeneracy.

## Symbolic regression (PySR, exp12)

- **Don't compare a sparse SR pick against the full linear model — it's an
  unfair test.** PySR's `model_selection="best"` minimizes a complexity-vs-loss
  score, so its "best" equation often *drops* genuinely useful linear features
  (e.g. it kept only `logmp` + `late` for an aperture, dropping `logtc`/`early`),
  making "symbolic vs linear" measure PySR's pruning, not the value of a
  nonlinear term. Fix: always keep the full linear core and test the
  *incremental* value of the discovered nonlinear term (`linear + correction`).
- **To find what a linear model misses, run SR on its residuals, not the raw
  target.** OLS residuals are orthogonal to the linear features, so SR can only
  surface *nonlinear* structure (or nothing). On the raw target, SR wastes its
  complexity budget rediscovering the dominant linear term (`logmp`) and the
  small nonlinearity never surfaces.
- **Restricting SR to `{+,-,*,square}` keeps every equation polynomial**, so it
  reduces to *sparse selection over polynomial cross-terms*: each equation
  expands to a few monomials that plug straight into the existing
  linear-Gaussian emulator (reusing all of exp07/exp11 — CRPS, calibration,
  covariance). Far cleaner than refitting arbitrary nonlinear constants per fold.
- **Validate the SR finding with a residual-vs-feature figure, not just CRPS.**
  The +2% CRPS gain was easy to dismiss as noise; the convex U-shape of the
  linear residual vs `late` made the `late²` term obviously real (AGENTS.md
  visualize-don't-trust-metrics mandate, again decisive).
- Small-subsample SR can mislead on *which* term wins (n=397 picked `logtc·late`
  everywhere; full n=2539 picked `late²` for the outskirts). Validate the
  pipeline small but read the *physics* off the full sample.
- PySR's first import triggers a one-time Julia backend install + precompile
  (~3–5 min); afterwards a full run (8 deterministic serial fits, n=2539) is
  ~100 s.

## Scatter / calibration (exp14)

- **Marginal calibration can be fine while conditional calibration is badly
  off.** The homoscedastic emulator's overall interval coverage matched nominal
  (so marginal CRPS barely moved), yet split by predicted noisiness it covered
  ~80% of clean halos and ~60% of noisy ones inside the 68% interval. Always
  check coverage *within noisiness/feature bins*, not just the aggregate — a
  conditional density model lives or dies on per-object honesty.
- **Heteroscedasticity ≠ sharpness.** Modeling feature-dependent variance gave
  almost no marginal-CRPS gain (+1.1%) but +0.24 nats joint log-score and a ~10×
  smaller conditional-coverage gap. Judge a scatter model by the joint score and
  conditional calibration, not marginal CRPS.
- **Fit the log-variance by Gaussian MLE, not by regressing log(resid^2).** The
  latter is biased (E[log r^2] = log sigma^2 - 1.27 for a Gaussian). Minimizing
  0.5*sum[s + r^2 e^{-s}] with s = log-variance (closed-form gradient, L-BFGS) is
  exact, ~instant, and easy to regularize (ridge the slopes, not the intercept).
- **Diagnose tails with PIT before adding a fancy likelihood.** Once the variance
  was made halo-dependent the PIT was flat (no U-shape) — the Gaussian was
  adequate and a Student-t/flow would have been wasted complexity. The defect was
  heteroscedasticity, not non-Gaussian tails.
- `late` (recent-accretion index) is the single axis that governs the outskirts:
  it carries the mean nonlinearity (exp12 late^2) *and* the excess scatter
  (exp14). Recent accretion both boosts and destabilizes the outer envelope.
- **A predictor unbiased in X looks biased when you bin residuals by the noisy
  truth Y** (exp15). E[pred - Y | Y] has slope exactly -(1-R^2) — regression to
  the mean — present for the mean OR sampled predictions, because the truth on
  the x-axis contains the noise being conditioned on. The +0.3 dex low-end "bias"
  that looked alarming was this artifact (measured slope matched -(1-R^2) to
  three decimals). Diagnose with a *reliability diagram* (bin by PREDICTED, plot
  mean true): slope 1.0 -> the mean is fine. The only cure is more explained
  variance (raise R^2), not a better functional form; when R^2 is at its ceiling
  the shrinkage is irreducible. For generative use, SAMPLE from the predictive —
  the mean-only point estimate is under-dispersed and misses the tails.

## Workflow

- Background `uv run` commands buffer stdout through pipes; redirect to a file
  and read that, or block on the process, rather than polling a pipe.
