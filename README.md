# HongShao: Recipe to Make a Massive Galaxy

----

## Motivation

* The ultimate goal is to have a forward model based on the two-phase formation scenario to fit a combination of observations of massive galaxies.
* But first, I will try to evaluate the uncertainty and bias involved in SED fitting for massive galaxies when photo-z uncertainties are present.
* Will also try to explore way to correct the impact of M/L gradient within the massive galaxy.
* Another interesting topic I want to explore is to choose a set of hyper-parameters to define priors of star-formation history (SFH) for massive galaxies within a narrow redshift range.
